# ðŸ“˜ Template for HydraVim user config

Base to create your HydraVim configuration, which allows you to keep the latest version installed without losing your modifications.

```vimscript
:HydraVimUserConfig
```
Use the command below to install the configuration template inside the `/nvim/lua/user/` folder.

## âœ¨ Note
That folder is not versioned, so even after updating HydraVim through `HydraVimUpdate`, you won't lose your configurations.
